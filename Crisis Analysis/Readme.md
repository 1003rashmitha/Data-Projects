A food delivery startup, named QuickBite Express faced a major crisis mid 2025. The Company witnessed a major drop in their orders, delayed deliveries and unhappy customers. I have created a dashboard to analyse data pre-crisis and post-crisis to uncover the causes.

Tools used:
- Power BI - Dashboard and Analytics
- DAX - Custom measures and KPIs
- Excel - Data cleaning and pre-processing

Key Insights:
1. The total order went from 114K to 35K, indicating ~69% drop. The total orders also took a dip by ~70%.
2. Active customer plummeted during the crisis and high value customers showed 100% order drop during crisis, indicating major retention issue.
3. SLA compliance dropped significantly, the delivery delays correlated with the cancellation spike.
4. During the crisis, the customer sentiment was largely negative with major "quality and safety" complaints, which meant that many customers lost trust.
5. Top restaurants witnessed major order decline

Possible fixes:
1. Fix the delivery operations, by implementing real-time SLA compliance and making it weather adaptive.
2. Flag restaurants with high negative food quality complaints.
3. Build trust by providing a "safety" badge on app.
